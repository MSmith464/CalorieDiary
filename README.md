Calorie Diary is a web application that lets you record your calorie intake
by using the Edamam Food Database api which can be found here: https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-docs.

**Installation**: 

Easiest way to install is to download the files and run *npm install*

To get the api to work, I suggest also installing Live-Server or else you will likely run into a CORS error.
You can do so by running *npm install live-server*

**Upcoming Updates**:

Currently working on a Django backend to store daily diaries so that weekly/monthly data is obtainable.
